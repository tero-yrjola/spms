Stock portfolio management system

Created for a school project. Used for tracking the realtime value of multiple stock-portfolios. Currently limited by the AlphaVantage-API (only 5 requests per minute).
One API-request is used to fetch the USD-EUR-ratio. Fetching a price per stock consumes one request and graphing the stocks also uses up one request per stock.
